Deyang Lin is an enrolled graduate student at Jilin University. He is currently on a leave of absence to co-found a robotics studio with his friends, primarily dedicated to designing robots for educational purposes and competitions. Within the studio, he assumes the role of a versatile robotics design engineer, exhibiting an unwavering passion for robotics. He possesses the ability to independently conceptualize, construct, and control the hardware and software systems of complex robots. Simultaneously, he ensures that the studio's products maintain a competitive edge in the market, both in terms of performance and pricing.

Academically, his research endeavors predominantly revolve around the field of point cloud perception. Presently, he is diligently striving to overcome the challenges associated with fusing perception from 2D images and 3D point clouds, thereby propelling the prospects of practical implementation of point cloud perception.
